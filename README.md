# DataBridge: Patient No-Show Prediction

This project simulates a real-world use case: helping a small clinic reduce appointment no-shows using machine learning. Built end-to-end using Python, this project demonstrates data analysis, classification modeling, business insight extraction, and dashboard deployment.

## Goal
Build a predictive model and dashboard to help clinic staff anticipate and reduce patient no-shows.

## Stack
- Python, pandas, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Streamlit
